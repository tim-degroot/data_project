# Land Rent Dashboards - Data Processing project
The aim of this project is to analyse different factors and their effect on land rents.

## Features
Contains different plotting functions:
- Plot column on map
- Plot correlation between column and land rents
- 
Contains two **interactive dashboards**:
- Plot the decomposition of effects in a certain location
- Plot the decomposition of one effect on a map

## Usage
The program uses two different data sources which can be replaced by other similar datasets. Multiple different datasets can be used to form one dataframe.
- [Grondprijzen per postcode, 2011](http://landvalues.nl/) was used as the source for land rents. Different data sources can be used instead if this data contains land rents (â‚¬/m2) and postal codes.
- [Kerncijfers per postcode, 2018](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/dossier/nederland-regionaal/geografische-data/gegevens-per-postcode) was used as the source for shapefiles of postal codes which are used for maps and for statistics per postal code.
